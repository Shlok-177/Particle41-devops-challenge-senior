# Extra Credit Feature

This project contains a CICD of simple Dockerized application that returns the current time.

---

This `ExtraCredit` branch contains the **Extra Credit!** feature.  
I have created a CI/CD pipeline that builds the Docker image of our app and deploys it to Docker Registry.

---

## Steps to create the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Created a `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` file.
2. Configured it to build the Docker image and push it to Docker Registry on each commit.
